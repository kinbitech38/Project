## MERN STACK IMPLEMENTATION 
## In this project, you are tasked to implement a web solution based on MERN stack in AWS Cloud.
## MERN Web stack consists of following components:
## MongoDB: A document-based, No-SQL database used to store application data in a form of documents.
## ExpressJS: A server side Web Application framework for Node.js.
## ReactJS: A frontend framework developed by Facebook. It is based on JavaScript, used to build User Interface (UI) components.
## Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
## As shown on the illustration above, a user interacts with the ReactJS UI components at the application front-end residing in the browser. This frontend is served by the application backend residing in a server, through ExpressJS running on top of NodeJS.
## Any interaction that causes a data change request is sent to the NodeJS based Express server, which grabs data from the MongoDB database if required, and returns the data to the frontend of the application, which is then presented to the user.
## Update ubuntu  
   'sudo apt update'
## Upgrade ubuntu
   'sudo apt upgrade'
## Lets get the location of Node.js software from Ubuntu repositories.
    'curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -'
## Install Node.js on the server
## Install Node.js with the command below
    'sudo apt-get install -y nodejs'
## Note: The command above installs both nodejs and npm. NPM is a package manager for Node like apt for Ubuntu, it is used to install Node modules & packages and to manage dependency conflicts.
## Verify the node installation with the command below
    'node -v' 
## Verify the node installation with the command below
    'npm -v' 
## Application Code Setup
## Create a new directory for your To-Do project:
    'mkdir Todo'
## Run the command below to verify that the Todo directory is created with ls command
    'ls'
## TIP: In order to see some more useful information about files and directories, you can use following combination of keys ls -lih â€“ it will show you different properties and size in human readable format. You can learn more about different useful keys for ls command with ls --help.
## Now change your current directory to the newly created one:
    'cd Todo'
## Next, you will use the command npm init to initialise your project, so that a new file named package.json will be created. This file will normally contain information about your application and the dependencies that it needs to run. Follow the prompts after running the command. You can press Enter several times to accept default values, then accept to write out the package.json file by typing yes.
    'npm init'
